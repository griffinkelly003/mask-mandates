        <p><b>NEW YORK</b> -- As the world gets closer to a COVID-19 vaccine, scientist still say one of the most effective ways to avoid spreading the virus that has killed more than 260,000 Americans is to wear a mask.
        </p>

        <p>The majority of the U.S. has enforced state-wide mask mandates for government buildings, schools, businesses, houses of worship and public transportation. Yet, 13 states, mainly in the Southeast and Midwest don't have state-wide mask
          mandates.</p>

        <p>Scientists agree non-vented masks such as surgical, cloth and N95 mitigate spreading the virus.</p>

        <p>In a study published in the American Institute of Physics, Sanjay Kumar from the National University of Singapore said, "The highly efficacious facemask, such as surgical masks with an estimated efficacy of around 70%, could lead to the
          eradication of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents use such masks in public consistently."</p>
